* ess-R-pkg-compile.el
An Emacs package that attempts to save you a few seconds when developing your R
package in ESS. These are early days and all input is welcome.

* Current functionality:
+ attempts to detach and re-load your R package after compilation
+ this is provided through a wrapper of the compile function that includes a post-compilation hook
+ it handles multiple R process
+ if a package could not be detached due to dependant packages those will also be detached
+ if detaching fails it will prompt you to restart the R process

* Usage:
+ download ess-R-pkg-compile.el and put in your path
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/ess-R-pkg-compile/")
(require 'ess-R-pkg-compile)
#+END_SRC
+ provide information to =ess-R-pkg-compile--compile= function e.g. like:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  (defun build-my-package ()
    "Build my R-package."
    (interactive)
    (ess-R-pkg-compile--compile "R CMD INSTALL" "~/my/path/" "my_package"))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-m") 'build-my-package)
#+END_SRC
+ =(setq ess-R-pkg-compile--buffer-kill-time 5)= can be set to automatically
  close the compilation buffer after some seconds.
